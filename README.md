Repository for learning python to use python with applications in the Animation/VFX industry. Assumes a basic understanding of python, see the [python101](https://github.com/MattRickS/python101) repository if you're learning python from scratch.

Each application has a readme file explaining the basics of how to get started with the python API for that application. The DCC (Digital Content Creator) applications come with a challenge so you can put your python knowledge to the test, and a solution file showing one way to complete it.

- [Blender](./blender/)
- [Houdini](./houdini/)
- [Maya](./maya/)
- [Nuke](./nuke/)
- [Shotgun](./shotgun/)

Unfortunately, not all DCCs support python. For some of these there may be more complicated workarounds/hacks for having some access via python, but these are quite complex and not for beginners.
