Repository for learning python to use with applications in the Animation/VFX industry. Assumes a basic understanding of python, see the [python101](https://github.com/MattRickS/python101) repository if you're learning python from scratch.

Each application has a readme file explaining the basics of how to get started with the python API for that application. The DCC (Digital Content Creator) applications come with a challenge so you can put your python knowledge to the test, and a solution file showing one way to complete it.
