Unfortunately, After Effects does not currently support native python scripting. The same is true for all the Adobe programs. There is one potential workaround that is _very_ hacky which is described below, but shouldn't be attempted unless you know what you're doing.

# Advanced Setup
For those who really, _really_ want to use python to talk to After Effects, it's possible to use a wrapper object to send JavaScript commands to After Effects and read the response. Yes, this still requires you to write every After Effects command in JavaScript, but could be beneficial if you need to combine some logic with other tools. Github user kingofthebongo has provided a repository with the core concept [here](https://github.com/kingofthebongo/AE_PyJsx/blob/master/AE_PyJsx.py) and implemented some example methods such as opening a scene, and checking what document is currently active. Any other operations would need to be implemented by you; writing both the javacript command and the python function that wraps it.
